title: Voice

The **Voice** mechanic indicates that we might use part of the clue said in a specific certain accent or style. This mechanic is similar in many ways to the [Homophone Mechanic](./homophones.md) and the two may be combined.

Common uses of this clue might be to say something with a Scottish accent, an American accent, a lisp, and so on.

## Examples

**As Sean Connery says, unmarried people getting viral disease (8)**

_As Sean Connery says_ suggests a voice clue, using a Scottish Accent. In this case if Sean Connery was to say "unmarried people", he might say "singles". In a Scottish accent, this could be said as "shingles" - which gives the straight-part and solution **shingles** (a viral disease).
