title: Voices
---

The **Voice** mechanic indicates that we might use part of the clue said in a specific certain accent or style. This mechanic is similar in many ways to the [Homophone Mechanic](./homophones.md) and the two may be combined.

Common uses of this clue might be to say something with a Scottish accent, an American accent, a lisp, and so on.

## Examples

<details>
  <summary>**As Sean Connery says, unmarried people getting viral disease (8)**</summary>

  Answer: **shingles**

  In this case if Sean Connery was to say "unmarried people", he might say "singles". In a Scottish accent, this could be said as "shingles" - which gives the straight-part and solution **shingles** (a viral disease).
  
  - _As Sean Connery says_: suggests a **voice** mechanic, using a Scottish Accent.
  - _unmarried people_: the part of the clue we 'voice' in a Scottish Accent - **singles** (unmarried people) is voiced as **shingles**.
  - _getting viral disease_: 'getting' suggest what follows is our answer, and the straight part is **viral disease** - or **shingles**.
