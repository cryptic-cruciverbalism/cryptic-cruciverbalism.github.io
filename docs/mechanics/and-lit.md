title: And Lit.
---

The **and literally'** mechanic (often abbreviated to '**and lit.**' or '**&lit.**') might not quite be a mechanic, but it is a term you will see in crosswords and describes a particularly elegant and prized type of clue. An &lit. clue is one which not only functions as a cryptic crossword clue but also reads in its entirety as wordplay on the answer.

The entire answer could often be considered a _[cryptic definition](./cryptic-definitions.md)_.

## Examples

<details>
  <summary>**Romantic film’s wild red-hot bad guy (3,9)**</summary>

  Answer: **The Bodyguard** ([A romantic thriller film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bodyguard_(1992_film)))

  In this cue **wild** indicates an anagram, using the letters from **red-hot bad guy** which gives the answer "The Bodyguard" - a romantic film.

  This clue is an &lit. because the _entire_ clue also works for the answer - the romantic film's red-hot bad guy is the lead actor Kevin Costner.

  - _Romantic film_: is the straight part - **The Bodyguard**.
  - _wild_: is an **[anagram](./anagrams.md)** indicator.
  - _red-hot-bad guy_: provides the letters for the anagram.

  <summary>**Scandalous author – disturbing eroticist, principally? (4)**</summary>

  Answer: **Sade** ([The Marquis de Sade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquis_de_Sade))

  In this cue **principally** indicates the [acrostic or leading letter](./acrostic.md) mechanic. The leading letters are "Sade".

  This clue is an &lit. because the _entire_ clue also works as a definition - the Marquis de Sade was famous for writing 100 Years of Sodom, a highly violent and sexualised book.

  Leading letter or acrostic clues can be a little easier to make &lit. as there is a lot of flexibility to choose the words used for the leading letters.
