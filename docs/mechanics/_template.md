title: Voices & Accents

The **Voice** or **Accent** mechanic indicates that we might use part of the clue said in a specific certain accent or style. This mechanic is similar in many ways to the [Homophone Mechanic](./homophones.md) and the two may be combined.

Common uses of this clue might be to say something with a Scottish accent, an American accent, a lisp, and so on.

## Examples

<details>
  <summary>**As Sean Connery says, unmarried people getting viral disease (8)**</summary>

  Answer: **shingles** ([a viral disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shingles))

  In this case if Sean Connery was to say "unmarried people", he might say "singles". In a Scottish accent, this could be said as "shingles" - which gives the straight-part and solution **shingles** (a viral disease).
  
  - _As Sean Connery says_: suggests a **voice** mechanic, using a Scottish Accent.
  - _unmarried people_: the part of the clue we 'voice' in a Scottish Accent - **singles** (unmarried people) is voiced as **shingles**.
  - _getting viral disease_: 'getting' suggest what follows is our answer, and the straight part is **viral disease** - or **shingles**.

  <summary>**Cockneys live in these units? (4)**</summary>

  Answer: **ohms** ([a unit of resistance in electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm))

  In a Cockney (London) accent the 'h' at the beginning of a word is often dropped. Cockney"s live in "homes" which is voiced as "'omes'". This is a homophone of "ohms" - which is a unit of resistance in electronics.
  
  - _Cockneys..._: suggests a **voice** mechanic, using a Cockney Accent.
  - _...live in these_: the part of the clue we 'voice' in a Cockney Accent - Cockney's live in **homes** which is voiced as **'omes**.
  - _units_: the straight part of the clue - **'omes** is a homophone of **ohms** which is the scientific **unit** of resistance - **ohms**.
