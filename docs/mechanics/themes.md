title: Themes
---

Perhaps not quite a mechanic, but a **theme** can be crucial to solving a crossword. A theme is simply a topic that links many (and very occasionally, all) of the clues. For example, if a theme for a crossword was "Music", then we might see answers such as "Rock", "Beethoven" and "Note". To misdirect, or provide some extra wordplay, some of the answers might relate to the theme distantly or with a bit of a leap of intuition.

If there is a theme in a crossword, some of the answers may be harder to get without knowing that theme - because it is possible the wordplay for a clue might relate to the theme, meaning some clues are _harder_ if you don't know that the answer could link to a topic. This means that identifying whether there is a theme might be crucial to solving the crossword.

A theme might not be obvious or explicit - it might only become apparent that there is a topic which links answers as you complete the crossword.

A theme might be related to current events or the date - for example a crossword in December might have a Christmas theme, or a crossword published during an election might have a political theme. Themes that relate to politics or current events might also be somewhat satirical.

It may be obvious that a theme is involved if you have clues that explicitly relate to another like so:

- People favouring the right kind of 11 (5)
- American kind of 11 having two members around (7)
- Laugh a tad oddly about kind of 11 getting attacked (3,1,3,2)

In this case it will be essential to get clue number 11:

- Spy university thus making notes on staff (5)

## Examples

Given the theme **music** the following clues TODO

<details>
  <summary>TODO</summary>

  Answer: TODO

  In this case if Sean Connery was to say "unmarried people", he might say "singles". In a Scottish accent, this could be said as "shingles" - which gives the straight-part and solution **shingles** (a viral disease).
  
  - _As Sean Connery says_: suggests a **voice** mechanic, using a Scottish Accent.
  - _unmarried people_: the part of the clue we 'voice' in a Scottish Accent - **singles** (unmarried people) is voiced as **shingles**.
  - _getting viral disease_: 'getting' suggest what follows is our answer, and the straight part is **viral disease** - or **shingles**.
