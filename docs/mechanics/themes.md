title: Themes
---

Perhaps not quite a mechanic, but a **theme** can be crucial to solving a crossword. A theme is simply a topic that links many (and very occasionally, all) of the clues. For example, if a theme for a crossword was "Music", then we might see answers such as "Rock", "Beethoven" and "Note". To misdirect, or provide some extra wordplay, some of the answers might relate to the theme distantly or with a bit of a leap of intuition.

If there is a theme in a crossword, some of the answers may be harder to get without knowing that theme - because it is possible the wordplay for a clue might relate to the theme, meaning some clues are _harder_ if you don't know that the answer could link to a topic. This means that identifying whether there is a theme might be crucial to solving the crossword.

## Identifying Themes

There are a number of ways themes might be suggested or identified in a crossword. I'm sure there are many more, but here's some examples.

### Explicit Themes

Simply looking at the clues might make the theme apparent, for example:

- President claiming one has hollow victories (8)
- Labour PM â€“ a dry and flipping slippery customer (6)
- Former PM, one gutless Tory for the greater part (8)

### Current Events or Topical Themes

A theme might be related to current events or the date - for example a crossword in December might have a Christmas theme, or a crossword published during an election might have a political theme. Themes that relate to politics or current events might also be somewhat satirical.

In this case there is clearly a presidents or prime minister theme. We might expect some satirical wordplay or answers, or clues and answers which are related to politics.

### Clue-Related Themes

It may be obvious that a theme is involved if you have clues that explicitly relate to another clue, like so:

- People favouring the right kind of 11 (5)
- American kind of 11 having two members around (7)
- Laugh a tad oddly about kind of 11 getting attacked (3,1,3,2)

In this case it will be essential to get clue number 11:

- Spy university thus making notes on staff (5)

### Emerging Themes

A theme might not be obvious or explicit - it might only become apparent that there is a topic which links answers as you complete the crossword.
