title: Cryptic Definitions

## Examples

<details>
  <summary>**Price of a suit? (5,5)**</summary>

  Answer: **Legal Costs**

  The surface suggests **suit** might be a piece of clothing, this is misdirection and the suit is in fact a **legal case**. The price of a case in court could be the **legal costs**. The **?** at the end of the clue is a hint that the clue might be a cryptic definition.

## Indicators

Cryptic definitions generally do not have indicators - the entire clue serves the definition. However, there can sometimes be a hint:

- A **question mark** at the end of a clue can sometimes emphasise that we have something particularly 'cryptic' and might suggest a cryptic definition. **Perhaps?** could also be used in this way. However, "Perhaps" might also indicate a [sort-of](../todo.md).
- An **exclamation point** at the end of a clue might indicate that once you get the answer you'll smile, suggesting some fun wordplay which might suggest a cryptic definition.
